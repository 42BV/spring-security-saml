# Spring SAML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-projects/spring-security-saml.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/)

## Upgrade note

This project is being rewritten in [Spring Security](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security). As such, [new feature requests](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/new) should be logged there.

In the past, there were `develop` and `develop-3.0` branches, though these are not maintained, and PRs are no longer being considered on these branches. No further releases will be issued from these two branches. Please feel free to fork the repository if you need to make changes.

We continue to consider pull requests for the 1.0.x branch, but are not actively developing it.

## Introduction

Spring SAML Extension allows seamless inclusion of SAML 2.0 Service Provider capabilities in Spring applications. All products supporting SAML 2.0 in Identity Provider mode (e.g. ADFS 2.0, Shibboleth, OpenAM/OpenSSO, Ping Federate, Okta) can be used to connect with Spring SAML Extension.
