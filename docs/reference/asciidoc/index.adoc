= Spring Security SAML v2
Filip Hanik <fhanik@pivotal.io>
v2.0

== Welcome to Spring Security SAML v2
*We've revised Spring Security SAML and are creating a 2.0 release train.
TLDR; Here is why*

* Truly abstract away the underlying SAML implementation which can be complex and difficult to use
* SAML data objects are Plain Old Java Objects (POJO)
* Unit testing and test driven development must be easy
* Out of the box support for
** Hosting a Service Provider (SP)
** Hosting an Identity Provider (IDP)
** Receive signed and/or encrypted assertions
** Send signed and/or encrypted assertions
** Multi tenancy support for both IDP and SP
** Key rotation
* Integration with Spring Security
* Built in registration DSL
* Uncomplicated RSA key handling, no more keystores
* Intuitive usage requiring less documentation
* Reducing the foot print of the library
